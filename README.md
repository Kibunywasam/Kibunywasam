Hi there — I'm Samuel Kibunywa

##  Purpose

I specialize in building tools that projects that combine data analysis with software development to solve real-world challenges across public health, economics, and community monitoring. As a junior data analyst expanding into full-stack development, I use these projects to experiment with tools that make insights scalable, visual, and actionable.

## 💻 Core Themes

- **Applied Statistics** — Statistical modelling, indicator tracking, data cleaning, and public reporting
- **Software Development** — Automating analytics workflows, creating user interfaces, integrating APIs
- **Dashboarding & Storytelling** — Using Tableau, python, and R Shiny to make data interactive

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 🧮 Kenya Inflation Forecast Analysis
Forecasting CPI trends using SARIMA techniqus in R and Tableau, with automated CSV exports for stakeholder-ready dashboards.

## 🚀 Learning & Future Goals

I'm actively deepening my skills in:
- Full-stack development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js)
- Proposal design for impact projects

My goal is to build tools that don’t just inform — but empower. Data is powerful when people can *use* it.
Moreso to the non-technical experts
